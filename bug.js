This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to open a URL that requires authentication.  The authentication process may fail silently, leaving the user with no indication of the error.  This is particularly problematic when the URL is for a sensitive resource or involves a critical application workflow.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

const openAuthURL = async (url) => {
  try {
    const result = await Linking.openURL(url);
    console.log('URL opened:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error opening URL:', error);
  }
};

// ...later in the application...
openAuthURL('https://auth.example.com/login');
```

The `Linking.openURL` function will succeed even if the user cancels the login, and there's no reliable way to know from the function result itself if the authentication was actually successful.
